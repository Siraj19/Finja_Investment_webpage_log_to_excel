# Finja_Investment_webpage_log_to_excel
This is a project that I initially created for my father to help him tracking his investment in Finja. What it does is that if we copy page your logged in finja account source page it has got all finja investment logs like amount, due date, and profit. What it does is that parse like html parser and then loads that data into excel file and what it does in addition is that it tells you your total investment, total return on your cumulative investment and the number of days left for maturity in the excel file. I have made source file open for everyone so that people can track their investments easily and get rid of doing monotonous tasks.
