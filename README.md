# Finja_Investment_webpage_log_to_excel
This is a project that I initially created for my father to help him tracking his investment in Finja. What it does is that if we copy page your logged in finja account source page it has got all finja investment logs like amount, due date, and profit. What it does is that parse like html parser and then loads that data into excel file and what it does in addition is that it tells you your total investment, total return on your cumulative investment and the number of days left for maturity in the excel file. I have made source file open for everyone so that people can track their investments easily and get rid of doing monotonous tasks.


**How it works?**
* Go to finja website and login to your profile
* By right click on browser you would find option of view the source page or press control u
* Copy paste that source page text to a text file and place that file in a folder where this main.py is placed. 
* Make sure you don't have any other text file in that folder and text file shouldn't be more than one
* Now just run "run.bat"
* If everything goes perfect, It would have successfully made the excel file and everything in that excel file like below and your text file would get empty which means work is done.

**To know more what it does? Open up the code and each line is explained and you can cross verify from the online documentation for specific libraries.
Most importantly your machine should be running Python and should have required libraries.**
